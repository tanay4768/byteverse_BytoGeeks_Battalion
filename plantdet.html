            <h1>Black spot</h1>
            <p>
              Black spot is one of the most common diseases found on roses, but
              it
              <br />
              can also occur on other ornamental and garden plants. This fungal
              <br />
              disease causes black, round spots that form on the upper sides of
              <br />
              leaves. Lower leaves are usually infected first. Severe
              infestations
              <br />
              cause infected leaves to turn yellow and fall off the plant.

            <p>
              Powdery mildew is a fungal disease that affects many of our <br />
              landscape plants, flowers, vegetables and fruits. Powdery mildew
              <br />
              is an easy one to identify. Infected plants will display a white
              <br />
              powdery substance that is most visible on upper leaf surfaces, but
              <br />
              it can appear anywhere on the plant including stems, flower buds,
              <br />
              and even the fruit of the plant

            <p>
              Because downy mildews differ from powdery mildews, it is important
              <br />
              to understand the differences between the two. Powdery mildews are
              <br />
              true fungal pathogens that display a white powdery substance on
              <br />
              the upper leaves.

            <h1>Blight</h1>
            <p>
              Plant blight is a common disease. Remember the potato famine in
              <br />
              the 1840s? As a result of the blight, one million people died.
              <br />
              But other than potatoes, blight also affects other plants, <br />
              particularly tomatoes. Blight is a fungal disease that spreads
              <br />
              through spores that are windborne

              Canker is often identified by an open wound that has been infected

              by fungal or bacterial pathogens. Some cankers are not serious
              <br />
              while others can be lethal. Canker occurs primarily on woody

              <br />

            <p>
              Fungal leaf spot disease can be found both indoors on houseplants, <br>
              and outdoors in the landscape. This occurs during warm, wet <br>
              conditions. As the disease progresses, the fungal spots grow large <br>
              enough to touch each other. At this point the leaf surface appears <br>
              more like blotches than spots
